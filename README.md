# WebDev-Learning 🚀

Welcome to **WebDev-Learning**!  
This repository is dedicated to re-practising and sharpening my skills in **Web Development** using the **MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)**.

## 📌 Purpose

As a Full Stack Developer, I created this repository to:

- Revisit and reinforce core concepts of the MERN stack.
- Organize practice code, experiments, and mini-projects in one place.
- Maintain consistency in learning and hands-on development.

- CRUD operations

### 🔹 Database (MongoDB)
- MongoDB with Mongoose
- Schema and Models
- Database Connections
- CRUD with MongoDB
